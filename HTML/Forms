characters.
The <input type="text"> defines a single-line input field for text input.
The <label> tag defines a label for many form elements.
The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.
The <input type="radio"> defines a radio button.
The <input type="checkbox"> defines a checkbox.
The <input type="submit"> defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler.
The form-handler is typically a file on the server with a script for processing input data.
The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute.
Each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted.
If the name attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all.

Form Attributes

The Action Attribute
The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.
Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.
If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page.
<form action="/action_page.php">

The Target Attribute
The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.
Value	                          Description
_blank	          The response is displayed in a new window or tab
_self	            The response is displayed in the current window
_parent	          The response is displayed in the parent frame
_top	            The response is displayed in the full body of the window
framename	        The response is displayed in a named iframe
The default value is _self.
<form action="/action_page.php" target="_blank">

The Method Attribute
The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.
The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").
The default HTTP method when submitting form data is get.
<form action="/action_page.php" method="get">
<form action="/action_page.php" method="post">
Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information.
GET:
Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
POST:
Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked.

The Autocomplete Attribute
The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.
When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before.
<form action="/action_page.php" autocomplete="on">

The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute.
When present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted.
